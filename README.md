Program that comments on your pets.
It asks for a name and information about your pets and thus outputs a message depending on what you response is.


## License

The 3-clause BSD License was chosen since it was pretty comprehensive as it allows individuals a good amount of freedom with the code but still asks them to credit the original contributors. In addition, it also includes that those who contributed to the original are not responsible for potential liabilities with products created with this code.

## Code of Conduct

We chose The Contributor Covenant code of conduct since it is very broad and could be applied to any project. It has very clear and universal standards and consequences for violations.
